=head1 NAME

Data::Undump - Perl extension for securely and quickly deserializing simple Data::Dumper dumps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Undump qw(undump);
  
  my $dump= Data::Dumper->new([$simple_thing])->Terse(1)->Dump();
  undump($dump);

B<Note that this is an early release. Please contact the author(s) if you intend to

=head2 EXPORT

By default exports the C<undump> subroutine.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 undump

Undumps a Data::Dumper style data structure.
Takes a plain string (magic not currently respected)
containing a Data::Dumper Terse/Deepcopy style C<Dumper> output
(ie. no C<$VAR1 => at the front allowed currently) and returns
either undef for a failed parse, or a scalar value of the
value parsed. Also, in case of a failed parse, an error message
will be available in the C<$@> variable.

Restricted to objects nested up to 100 items deep.

=head1 POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS

Support for the following isn't implemented but might be in
future enhancements.

 * String magic on input scalar
 * qr//
 * ref to object. Eg \['foo']
 * Make it possible to parse a list instead of a scalar.
 * Blessed objects?
 * Cyclic structures?
 * Less/more tolerant parsing rules?
 * Filters? (Block things by their position in the structure?)
 * Conversion? (IE, we have '[1,1,1]' in the input, and we know we wont
 *    need it so parse it as '1,1,1' instead.
